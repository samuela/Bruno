Bruno: A Text Editor for Programming by Demonstration
=====================================================

Created by Samuel Ainsworth, Frank Goodman, Jonathan Lessinger, and Michael 
Scheer

Motivation
----------

Bruno's purpose is to provide an elegant way to demonstrate the evolution of 
code. Software development relies heavily on iterative and incremental 
development, and Bruno was designed to showcase this process on a step-by-step 
basis. Through its extensive plugin, simple command, and intuitive edit 
history interfaces, teaching and demonstrating software development has never 
been easier.

Quick Start
-----------

With the proper dependencies installed in `lib`, you can run Bruno by 
executing "ant run". Tests can be run from the Eclipse JUnit integrated tester.
