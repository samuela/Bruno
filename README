Plugin stuff

to run a script, place it inside a plugin (a folder). Create a File pointing to the plugin. Load the file with loadPlugin. 

loadPlugin returns the plugin; you must save a reference to it in order to run any scripts in it. to run:

get the script from the plugin with getScriptByName

run executeScript(Script)



This interface should change. I've implemented executeScript(String scriptName) which I can expose.

A script's name is the file name without the extension. Example:

The script ~/hello.py is named "hello".

A particular script name can only exist in one plugin, and it can only exist once in that plugin. This makes sense: calling a script by name should not be ambiguous.

If the client loads hello.py into a PluginManager and then attempts to load hello.js into the same PluginManager, a message is printed to standard error and the PluginManager skips hello.js.
